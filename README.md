# DS4-32
This work is based on [rodneybakiskan's PS5 library for ESP32](https://github.com/rodneybakiskan/ps5-esp32). It is adapted to the previous mappings for DualShock 4 that work was also inspired by.

## Disclaimer
I didn't create this from scratch. I only changed the source file for my own project.
